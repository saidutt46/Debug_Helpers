# Debugging Network Connections and Telnet/Process Issues

This guide provides a reference for diagnosing network connection problems, Telnet process issues, and monitoring CPU usage. It covers how to list and analyze processes (like Telnet), examine network ports and states with `netstat`, monitor CPU usage via command-line, and general troubleshooting/cleanup steps for orphaned or stuck processes.

## 1. Process Monitoring Commands

To identify if Telnet (or any process) is running, use Windows tools like **Tasklist**, **WMIC**, or **PowerShell**:

- **Tasklist (CMD):**  
  - `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq telnet.exe"` – Lists tasks filtered to the Telnet client process (telnet.exe). The `/FI` option applies a filter (here by image name) ([taskkill | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/taskkill#:~:text=section%20of%20this%20article,child%20processes%20started%20by%20it)). If Telnet is running, you'll see an entry with its *Image Name*, *PID*, *Session*, and memory usage.  
  - `tasklist /V` – Verbose list of all running tasks, including additional info like CPU time and window title. Useful for spotting hung tasks or those without a visible window (which could indicate an orphaned process).  
  - `wmic process where "Name='telnet.exe'" get ProcessId,ParentProcessId,CommandLine` – Uses WMI to find the Telnet process, showing its Process ID and Parent Process ID. The ParentProcessId helps identify **orphaned processes** (processes whose parent has exited). If the parent PID is not running, the Telnet process is orphaned ([windows - Powershell find orphaned processes - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/791851/powershell-find-orphaned-processes#:~:text=I%20know%20this%20is%20an,following%20solution%20performs%20quite%20well)). Orphaned Telnet processes may linger if the Telnet session didn’t close properly.  

- **PowerShell:**
  - `Get-Process -Name Telnet` – Retrieves the Telnet process by name (if it’s running). It displays the process **Name**, **Id** (PID), **CPU** time, etc. (CPU here is total processor time used, in seconds ([Fetch top 10 processes utilizing high CPU as shown in task manager | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/windowspowershell/fetch-top-10-processes-utilizing-high-cpu-as-shown-in-task-manager/1239627#:~:text=processor%20time%20that%20the%20process,on%20all%20processors%2C%20in%20seconds))). If Telnet isn’t found, no output (or an error) is produced.  
  - `Get-WmiObject Win32_Process -Filter "Name='telnet.exe'" | Select ProcessId, ParentProcessId, CommandLine` – Another way to get the process and its parent, similar to the WMIC query, but using PowerShell’s WMI interface. This can confirm if a Telnet process is running and whether its parent process exists.  

**Identifying Orphaned Processes:** An orphaned process is one whose parent process has terminated, leaving it running with no controller. If you suspect orphaned Telnet processes (e.g., Telnet sessions that didn’t close), compare each Telnet process’s ParentProcessId against running PIDs. Any Telnet process whose parent PID is not in the active process list is an orphan ([windows - Powershell find orphaned processes - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/791851/powershell-find-orphaned-processes#:~:text=I%20know%20this%20is%20an,following%20solution%20performs%20quite%20well)). These often have no console window or service associated. You can use the above WMI queries or tools like **Process Explorer** to find parent-child relationships. Once identified, such processes can be terminated manually (see **Process Termination and Cleanup** below).

## 2. Network Analysis Commands

Network issues, especially with Telnet (which typically uses TCP port 23), can be diagnosed with `netstat` and filtering commands:

- **View Active Connections:**  
  - `netstat -ano` – Displays **all** active TCP connections and listening ports, in numeric form, with the owning process **ID (PID)** for each ([netstat | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat#:~:text=,tcpv6%2C%20udpv6%2C%20icmpv6%2C%20or%20ipv6)). The columns are **Proto** (protocol), **Local Address** (your machine’s IP:port), **Foreign Address** (remote IP:port), **State** (TCP state), and **PID** ([7 netstat Command Usage on Windows with Example](https://geekflare.com/dev/netstat-command-usage-on-windows/#:~:text=Proto%20Local%20Address%20Foreign%20Address,204%3Ahttps%20TIME_WAIT%20UDP%20%5Bfe80%3A%3A998c%3Ad2d%3A17df%3A65d9%2512%5D%3A58903)) ([7 netstat Command Usage on Windows with Example](https://geekflare.com/dev/netstat-command-usage-on-windows/#:~:text=Proto%20Local%20Address%20Foreign%20Address,152%3Ahttps%20ESTABLISHED%2010556)). Use this to see if a Telnet connection exists or if port 23 is in use. For example, a listening Telnet server would appear as `Local Address 0.0.0.0:23` with state LISTENING. An active Telnet client connection might show your local port -> remote:23 in ESTABLISHED or other states.
  - *Filtering by port:* `netstat -ano | findstr :23` – Filters the netstat output to lines containing “:23”, i.e., any connection or listening socket on port 23. This quickly reveals if any process is using the Telnet port. If you see output with `:23` in either Local or Foreign address, note the PID at the end of the line – that’s the process using the port. You can then map that PID back to a process name with Task Manager or `tasklist /FI "PID eq <pid>"` ([netstat | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat#:~:text=,tcpv6%2C%20udpv6%2C%20icmpv6%2C%20or%20ipv6)).
  - *Filtering by state:* You can filter for specific TCP states. For example:  
    - `netstat -an | findstr ESTABLISHED` – Lists all connections currently in the **ESTABLISHED** state (active open connections).  
    - `netstat -an | findstr LISTENING` – Shows all listening ports (useful to see if a server is waiting on a port).  
    - `netstat -an | findstr CLOSE_WAIT` – Shows connections in **CLOSE_WAIT** state. `CLOSE_WAIT` indicates the remote side has closed the connection and the local side (your machine) is waiting to close ([windows - What are CLOSE_WAIT and TIME_WAIT states? - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/173535/what-are-close-wait-and-time-wait-states#:~:text=,has%20closed%20the%20connection)). Many CLOSE_WAIT entries could mean the Telnet client isn’t properly closing sockets.  
    - `netstat -an | findstr TIME_WAIT` – Shows connections in **TIME_WAIT** state. `TIME_WAIT` means your side closed the connection and is waiting to ensure all packets are received before fully closing ([windows - What are CLOSE_WAIT and TIME_WAIT states? - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/173535/what-are-close-wait-and-time-wait-states#:~:text=,has%20closed%20the%20connection)). Many TIME_WAIT entries on port 23 would appear after closing Telnet connections (they typically last a couple of minutes before disappearing).  
    - *Note:* You can replace the findstr keyword with any other TCP state (e.g., **SYN_SENT**, **FIN_WAIT**) to debug specific scenarios. For a complete list of TCP states, see netstat documentation (e.g., ESTABLISHED, LISTEN, CLOSE_WAIT, TIME_WAIT, etc.) ([netstat | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat#:~:text=State%20Indicates%20the%20state%20of,SYN_RECEIVED)).
  - The `-n` flag (already included above) is important because it avoids DNS lookups; output stays numeric, which is faster and shows raw port numbers ([netstat | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat#:~:text=,In)). The `-a` flag ensures **all** connections and listeners are shown (not just active ones) ([netstat | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat#:~:text=Parameter%20Description%20,consuming%20and%20will%20fail)). The `-o` flag adds the PID, helping link connections to processes ([netstat | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat#:~:text=,tcpv6%2C%20udpv6%2C%20icmpv6%2C%20or%20ipv6)).  

- **Identify Processes Bound to Ports:** Each line from `netstat -ano` has a PID. Once you have a suspicious PID (for example, one listening on port 23 or stuck in CLOSE_WAIT), use `tasklist /FI "PID eq <pid>"` to get the process name associated with that PID ([netstat | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat#:~:text=,tcpv6%2C%20udpv6%2C%20icmpv6%2C%20or%20ipv6)). Alternatively, on PowerShell: `Get-Process -Id <pid>` will show the process name for that ID.  
  - *Example:* If `netstat -ano | find ":23"` returns a line ending in PID 1234, then `tasklist /FI "PID eq 1234"` might show `tlntsvr.exe` – which is the Telnet Server service on Windows ([ReviverSoft | Tlntsvr.exe Process - What is Tlntsvr.exe? - Reviversoft](https://www.reviversoft.com/en/processes/tlntsvr.exe?ncr=1#:~:text=Telnet%20Server%20Service%20is%20the,and%20since%20it%20is%20installed)). Or it might show `telnet.exe` (the client) if it’s an active outbound connection. This cross-reference helps confirm which process is using the network port in question.

- **Advanced netstat usage:**  
  - `netstat -bano` (requires Administrator) – Similar to above but with the `-b` flag to show the executable name for each connection. This can directly list the process name next to each connection *if run with elevated permissions* ([netstat | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat#:~:text=computer%20is%20listening.%20,unless%20you%20have%20sufficient%20permissions)). It’s useful to see at a glance which program is listening on or connecting to a port. (It may take longer to run, as it tries to map each connection to a process and can be denied by some processes for security.)  
  - `netstat -p tcp -ano` – You can combine `-p <Protocol>` to limit output to TCP only (or UDP). For instance, focusing on TCP (which Telnet uses) will ignore UDP noise.  
  - **Interpreting output:** In the netstat listing, pay attention to the **State** column:
    - `LISTENING` means a process is waiting for incoming connections on that port (for Telnet, typically the server daemon).
    - `ESTABLISHED` means an open, active connection exists.
    - `CLOSE_WAIT` and `TIME_WAIT` indicate closing connections as explained above (remote closed vs. local closed) ([windows - What are CLOSE_WAIT and TIME_WAIT states? - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/173535/what-are-close-wait-and-time-wait-states#:~:text=,has%20closed%20the%20connection)).
    - `SYN_SENT` or `SYN_RECEIVED` might appear if a connection is in the process of being established (useful if Telnet is stuck trying to connect).
    - If you see no entry for port 23 at all and you expect one, that means no process is currently using port 23. In that case, Telnet might not have started, or it’s using a non-standard port.

## 3. CPU Usage and Performance Monitoring

High CPU usage can indicate a hung process or resource issue. Use these commands to monitor CPU load and identify culprit processes:

- **Overall CPU Load (WMIC):**  
  - `wmic cpu get loadpercentage` – Returns the overall CPU usage percentage of your system at that moment. For example, it might return a value like `LoadPercentage 12` (meaning 12% CPU in use). This is a quick check of how busy the CPU is. You can also run it continuously with an interval: `wmic cpu get loadpercentage /every:5` will update the CPU load every 5 seconds ([Command line to check 100% CPU on Windows ? – Jacques Dalbera's IT world](https://itworldjd.wordpress.com/2016/05/05/command-line-100-cpu-on-windows/#:~:text=CPU%20load%3A%20c%3A%5C,loadpercentage%20LoadPercentage)). If your system is near 100% for extended periods, you likely have a process consuming too much CPU time.
  
- **Per-Process CPU usage (PowerShell):**  
  - `Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending` – Lists running processes, sorted by CPU time used (most CPU-intensive at top). The **CPU** property here is the total processor time (in seconds) that each process has accumulated ([Fetch top 10 processes utilizing high CPU as shown in task manager | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/windowspowershell/fetch-top-10-processes-utilizing-high-cpu-as-shown-in-task-manager/1239627#:~:text=processor%20time%20that%20the%20process,on%20all%20processors%2C%20in%20seconds)). Sorting by this in descending order brings the processes that have used the most CPU (generally the ones currently or recently taxing the CPU) to the top ([Fetch top 10 processes utilizing high CPU as shown in task manager | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/windowspowershell/fetch-top-10-processes-utilizing-high-cpu-as-shown-in-task-manager/1239627#:~:text=Next%2C%20you%27ll%20want%20to%20use,numbers%20are%20at%20the%20top)). This helps identify which processes are likely consuming the most CPU. You might append `| Select-Object -First 5` to just see the top 5. For example, to get the top 10 CPU-consuming processes:  
    ```powershell
    Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 10
    ```  
    This will output the 10 processes with highest CPU time (along with their IDs, etc.) ([Fetch top 10 processes utilizing high CPU as shown in task manager | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/windowspowershell/fetch-top-10-processes-utilizing-high-cpu-as-shown-in-task-manager/1239627#:~:text=Put%20that%20all%20together%20and,you%20get%20something%20like%20this)).
  - **Note:** The `CPU(s)` column shown by `Get-Process` is cumulative, not a live percentage ([Fetch top 10 processes utilizing high CPU as shown in task manager | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/windowspowershell/fetch-top-10-processes-utilizing-high-cpu-as-shown-in-task-manager/1239627#:~:text=Notice%20that%20there%20is%20a,on%20all%20processors%2C%20in%20seconds)). For real-time CPU *percentages* (like Task Manager shows), one would need performance counters (e.g., `Get-Counter` or WMI `Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process`), but those are more advanced. As a quick check, the highest CPU-time process is often the one currently consuming CPU if you haven’t rebooted recently.

- **Identify High CPU Processes (CMD):**  
  - `tasklist /FI "CPUTIME gt 00:00:10"` – This filters running processes to those with more than 10 seconds of CPU time ([Command line to check 100% CPU on Windows ? – Jacques Dalbera's IT world](https://itworldjd.wordpress.com/2016/05/05/command-line-100-cpu-on-windows/#:~:text=Any%20Task%20running%20more%20than,tasklist%20%2FFI%20%E2%80%9CCPUTIME%20gt%2000%3A00%3A10%E2%80%9D)). Adjust the HH:MM:SS as needed. A process that has accumulated a lot of CPU time (especially if the system hasn’t been up long) is a candidate for being a CPU hog. This command helps quickly find processes that have been busy. (For example, if a Telnet process is stuck in a loop, its CPU time would continually grow.)
  - You can also use **Task Manager** or **Resource Monitor** for a real-time view, but the above command-line methods are useful when working over command-line or scripts (e.g., on a server without a GUI).  

- **Memory and other info:** While focusing on CPU, it might be useful to also note memory usage. `tasklist` shows each process’s working set (Mem Usage). PowerShell’s `Get-Process` shows handles, threads, WS, etc. If Telnet (or any process) is using excessive CPU, check if it’s also growing in memory or handle count, which could indicate a leak or wider issue. Sorting by other properties: e.g. `Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property WorkingSet -Descending` for memory, or using `wmic process get name, workingsetsize, threadcount` can give a snapshot of resource usage per process.

## 4. Troubleshooting Steps

Use these steps to troubleshoot Telnet issues and orphaned processes:

- **Telnet running under a different name:** Ensure you’re looking for the correct process. The Telnet **client** on Windows is usually `telnet.exe`. However, the Telnet **server** service runs as `TlntSvr.exe` ([ReviverSoft | Tlntsvr.exe Process - What is Tlntsvr.exe? - Reviversoft](https://www.reviversoft.com/en/processes/tlntsvr.exe?ncr=1#:~:text=Telnet%20Server%20Service%20is%20the,and%20since%20it%20is%20installed)). If you’re expecting a Telnet service, search for `tlntsvr` (e.g., `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq tlntsvr.exe"` or `Get-Process -Name tlntsvr`). For third-party Telnet servers or clients (including MKS Toolkit’s telnet or others), the process name could differ. Use broad searches: `tasklist | findstr /I "telnet"` to catch any process with "telnet" in its name (case-insensitive). If Telnet was launched via a script or another program, it might not show as a standalone `telnet.exe` (for instance, it could be running within a shell process). In that case, identify the parent process that invoked Telnet and look for it.  

- **Check for other processes using the port:** If Telnet connections fail or the service won’t start, another process might already be using port 23 (the default Telnet port). Use the `netstat -ano | findstr :23` command from Section 2 to see if port 23 is occupied. If you find a PID using that port that isn’t Telnet, that process is conflicting. For example, if a leftover instance of a Telnet server is hung and still holding the port, new sessions can’t start. Kill or stop the offending process so Telnet can use the port (or configure Telnet to use a different port if needed). Similarly, if you suspect a different port, change `:23` to that port number in the findstr filter. Always ensure the intended service isn’t being blocked by an unexpected process occupying its port.

- **Diagnose and kill orphaned processes:** If you find “ghost” Telnet processes (or any process) that shouldn’t be running (perhaps from previous sessions), you’ll want to terminate them. First, confirm they’re truly orphaned – e.g., using `wmic process where (ProcessId=<pid>) get ParentProcessId` to get the parent, then see if that parent PID exists. If not, it’s orphaned. Or use the PowerShell method from Section 1 (WMI query) to list all processes with their parent PIDs, and identify those whose parent is gone ([windows - Powershell find orphaned processes - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/791851/powershell-find-orphaned-processes#:~:text=I%20know%20this%20is%20an,following%20solution%20performs%20quite%20well)). Once confirmed, proceed to kill the process (see Section 5 below for commands). Orphaned processes can consume resources or keep ports open (like an orphaned Telnet keeping port 23 busy). In addition, investigate **why** the process became orphaned – e.g., did the parent crash? Was there a missing timeout (see next point)? Understanding the cause can prevent future occurrences.

- **Consider adding a timeout (MKS Toolkit scenarios):** If you are using Telnet within an MKS Toolkit environment or scripts, note that the Telnet client may hang indefinitely if it cannot connect or if the remote side doesn't respond. MKS Toolkit provides Unix-like tools on Windows, but not all GNU utilities are present by default. If your Telnet command doesn’t have a built-in timeout, you may need to implement one. For example, on GNU/Linux one might use the `timeout` command to limit how long `telnet` runs ([linux - telnet command with custom timeout duration - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/224623/telnet-command-with-custom-timeout-duration#:~:text=18)). In MKS Toolkit, you can simulate this: one approach is to run Telnet in the background and use the `sleep` command followed by `kill` to terminate Telnet after X seconds. For instance, using a Korn shell script:
  ```sh
  telnet host port &           # start telnet in background
  TELNET_PID=$!                # capture its PID
  sleep 10 && kill -9 $TELNET_PID &
  wait $TELNET_PID
  ```  
  This will force-kill the Telnet process after 10 seconds if it’s still running. Alternatively, if MKS Toolkit includes a `timeout` utility similar to GNU coreutils, you could do:  
  ```sh
  echo quit | timeout 5 telnet host port
  ```  
  which pipes a "quit" command to telnet and limits its execution to 5 seconds ([linux - telnet command with custom timeout duration - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/224623/telnet-command-with-custom-timeout-duration#:~:text=18)). The key is to ensure a hanging Telnet doesn’t persist indefinitely. If you frequently find orphaned Telnet processes, implementing a timeout or error-check in your script is advisable.

- **If no results are returned:** If your searches show nothing (e.g., `tasklist` finds no Telnet process, `netstat` shows no port 23 usage), consider: (1) Telnet might not be running at all – verify that the Telnet client or server is actually launched/enabled. On newer Windows, Telnet client is an optional feature that might need enabling, and Telnet server (TlntSvr) is usually disabled by default ([ReviverSoft | Tlntsvr.exe Process - What is Tlntsvr.exe? - Reviversoft](https://www.reviversoft.com/en/processes/tlntsvr.exe?ncr=1#:~:text=Telnet%20Server%20Service%20is%20the,and%20since%20it%20is%20installed)). (2) You might be searching the wrong system – ensure you run these commands on the correct machine (or use the `/S <remote>` option in tasklist/wmic to target a remote host if needed). (3) The process might be named unexpectedly – double-check the service or program name. If you expected something on port 23 but `netstat` is empty, maybe the service is configured for a different port or isn’t listening due to an error. Check firewall or service status in such cases. In summary, no output generally means the process/connection isn’t present – you may need to start the service or adjust your search criteria.

## 5. Process Termination and Cleanup

When you identify a rogue or orphaned Telnet process (or any process that needs to be stopped), you can terminate it using command-line tools:

- **Taskkill (CMD):**  
  - `taskkill /PID <pid> /F` – Forcefully terminate the process with the given PID. The `/F` flag is for force, which will kill the process without prompting ([taskkill | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/taskkill#:~:text=%2Fim%20%60,child%20processes%20started%20by%20it)). Use this when normal termination isn’t working or the process is hung. Example: `taskkill /PID 1234 /F` will kill PID 1234 (if you have permission). You can also kill by image name: `taskkill /IM telnet.exe /F` to kill all instances of telnet.exe ([taskkill | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/taskkill#:~:text=section%20of%20this%20article,child%20processes%20started%20by%20it)). Be cautious with wildcards (e.g., `taskkill /IM telnet* /F`) as it could match unintended processes.
  - Add `/T` to also terminate any child processes started by the target. For example, if Telnet had launched another subprocess, `taskkill /PID 1234 /F /T` would ensure that child is gone too ([taskkill | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/taskkill#:~:text=%2Fim%20%60,child%20processes%20started%20by%20it)). This is useful for terminating an entire process tree of an orphan, though Telnet typically doesn’t spawn children.
  - Always verify you have the correct PID or process name before killing, to avoid stopping the wrong process (especially on servers). You can do a dry run by listing the task (`tasklist /FI "PID eq 1234"`) to confirm its identity.

- **PowerShell Stop-Process:**  
  - `Stop-Process -Id <pid> -Force` – Equivalent to taskkill, using the process ID. `-Force` ensures the process is killed even if it's not cooperating.  
  - `Stop-Process -Name "telnet" -Force` – Kills all processes with the name “telnet” ([Stop-Process (Microsoft.PowerShell.Management) - PowerShell | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/stop-process?view=powershell-7.5#:~:text=Example%201%3A%20Stop%20all%20instances,of%20a%20process)). (PowerShell matches the process name, which is similar to the image name without extension.) For example, `Stop-Process -Name "tlntsvr" -Force` would stop the Telnet server service if running. This cmdlet can be more convenient in scripts and also allows filtering by other properties (via Where-Object if needed).
  - PowerShell provides more flexibility (e.g., you could combine finding and stopping in one line: `Get-Process telnet | Stop-Process -Force`). However, the end result is the same termination signal to the process.

- **MKS Toolkit (Unix-style `kill`):**  
  - In the MKS Toolkit shell (Korn shell or similar), you can use the `kill` command as on Unix. For instance, `kill -9 <PID>` sends a forced termination (SIGKILL) to the process with that PID. MKS Toolkit’s `kill` will translate the signal to terminate the Windows process (effectively like taskkill /F) ([kill -- terminate process - MKS Toolkit](https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/kill.1.asp#:~:text=SYNOPSIS.%20kill%20,by%20sending%20it%20a%20signal)). You might use `ps` in MKS (if available) to list processes and then `kill` by PID. Signals like `-9` (kill immediately) or `-15` (graceful termination) are available, but on Windows most signals map to just killing the process. Always prefer a graceful exit if possible (signal 15), but if the process is stuck, `-9` is the sure way.
  - *Example:* `kill -9 1234` would abruptly terminate PID 1234. If you have a list of Telnet PIDs (say from `ps -ef | grep telnet`), you could script kills for each. Ensure you have rights to kill the process (in Windows, that typically means running as an Administrator or the same user who owns the process).

- **Automating Cleanup:** If orphaned Telnet processes are a recurring issue, consider automating their cleanup:
  - **Batch script:** You can write a batch file that uses `taskkill` to terminate any stray Telnet processes. For example:  
    ```bat
    @echo off
    for /f "tokens=2 delims=," %%P in ('tasklist /FI "imagename eq telnet.exe" /FO CSV /NH') do (
        REM %%P is the PID from the CSV output
        taskkill /PID %%P /F
    )
    ```  
    This snippet filters tasklist to telnet.exe processes (CSV output, no header) and then kills each by PID. This could be scheduled (e.g., via Task Scheduler) to run periodically if needed.
  - **PowerShell script:** A one-liner example:  
    ```powershell
    Get-Process telnet -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
    ```  
    This will attempt to get any telnet processes and kill them. You could schedule this as a task or run it on-demand. You could also add logic to log occurrences (so you know how often it happens).
  - **MKS Toolkit script:** As discussed in the timeout section, you can incorporate `kill` commands after checks or delays. For instance, have a monitoring script that checks for defunct processes and kills them. MKS also has the ability to run cron-like scheduled tasks via the Windows scheduler or its own scheduling if set up.
  - **Preventive measures:** Ultimately, the best solution is preventing orphaned processes in the first place. Ensure your Telnet sessions have proper timeouts or error handling to exit cleanly. If Telnet is part of a service, check for patches or known issues (for example, some Telnet server implementations had bugs that left sessions hanging). If using scripts, always handle the case where the remote host is unreachable (so the script doesn’t hang forever waiting). 

By using the above commands and steps, you can systematically debug network connection issues, find out if Telnet (or any process) is misbehaving, and take corrective action by terminating or configuring processes. This structured approach helps in quickly pinpointing common issues like port conflicts, hung sessions (evident from CLOSE_WAIT states or high CPU usage), and orphaned processes, ensuring your system’s network services and performance remain healthy.


You're going into this meeting well-prepared, and I’ll make sure you look sharp in front of your manager. Below is your **ultimate cheat sheet** for debugging the Telnet issue on Windows (Command Prompt + PowerShell) and MKS Toolkit. This will help you **identify orphaned Telnet processes, check CPU usage, monitor network activity, and analyze process lifetimes.**

## 🚀 **Telnet & Process Investigation Cheat Sheet**
### **1️⃣ Identify Running Telnet Processes**
These commands will help **find all running Telnet processes**, see which ones are consuming high CPU, and check if they are orphaned.

#### **🔹 Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe)**
```cmd
tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq telnetd.exe"
```
- Lists all running Telnet processes.
- Look for **multiple entries**—each jocurb should have **one instance**, but if Telnetd isn’t idling, you’ll see sustained CPU use.

```cmd
tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq telnetd.exe" /V
```
- Shows **detailed info** including session name, CPU time, and memory usage.

```cmd
wmic process where "name='telnetd.exe'" get ProcessId,CommandLine,CreationDate
```
- Shows **when each Telnetd process started** and **what command launched it**.
- **Look for older processes that never closed.**

#### **🔹 PowerShell**
```powershell
Get-Process -Name telnetd | Select-Object Id, StartTime, CPU, ProcessName
```
- Shows **Telnet processes**, when they **started**, and their **CPU usage**.

```powershell
Get-Process telnetd | Sort-Object CPU -Descending
```
- Sorts Telnet processes by **highest CPU usage**.

```powershell
(Get-Process telnetd).Threads.Count
```
- Check **how many threads** are running for Telnetd. **If it's unusually high, it may be stuck.**

---

### **2️⃣ Check Network Ports Used by Telnet**
Find **which ports Telnetd is using** and whether they remain **open after the job is completed**.

#### **🔹 Windows Command Prompt**
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :23
```
- Lists **active Telnet connections** (Port **23** is the default for Telnet).
- Look for **stale connections** that remain **open even after the job is done**.

```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr ESTABLISHED
```
- Lists **all active network connections**.
- If **Telnet connections remain open too long**, the job might not be properly releasing resources.

```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr CLOSE_WAIT
```
- If many Telnet processes show **CLOSE_WAIT**, it means **the job server (J1) is not closing the connection properly.**

#### **🔹 PowerShell**
```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 23 | Format-Table -AutoSize
```
- Shows **current Telnet connections**, their **state**, and which **process is using them**.

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -State Established | Where-Object { $_.LocalPort -eq 23 }
```
- Filters **only active Telnet connections**.

---

### **3️⃣ Find Orphaned Telnet Sessions**
If a **Telnet process starts but doesn’t idle**, it means it’s staying **active instead of handing off control**.

#### **🔹 Windows Command Prompt**
```cmd
query session
```
- Shows **active user sessions**—if Telnet is still active after the job finishes, it might be stuck.

```cmd
quser
```
- Similar to `query session`, shows **who is using the system**.

```cmd
whoami /all
```
- Helps check **if the Telnet process is running under the correct user**.

#### **🔹 PowerShell**
```powershell
Get-WmiObject Win32_Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "telnetd.exe" } | Select-Object ProcessId,ParentProcessId
```
- This tells you **if Telnetd is properly handing off execution**.
- If **ParentProcessId** is 0 or missing, it's likely orphaned.

```powershell
(Get-WmiObject Win32_Process -Filter "Name='telnetd.exe'").CreationDate
```
- Shows **when each Telnetd process was created**.
- If it’s been running **longer than expected**, it's likely stuck.

---

### **4️⃣ Investigate CPU Usage**
Check **CPU usage of orphaned processes** to confirm **which Telnet sessions are causing high spikes.**

#### **🔹 Windows Command Prompt**
```cmd
wmic process where "name='telnetd.exe'" get ProcessId,ThreadCount,WorkingSetSize,CommandLine
```
- If **ThreadCount is too high**, it means the Telnet process is getting stuck.

```cmd
wmic cpu get loadpercentage
```
- If CPU load is **high** and **Telnetd is using most of it**, that’s your culprit.

#### **🔹 PowerShell**
```powershell
Get-Process telnetd | Measure-Object -Property CPU -Sum
```
- Gives **total CPU usage** of all Telnet processes.

```powershell
(Get-WmiObject Win32_Processor).LoadPercentage
```
- System-wide **CPU load**.

---

### **5️⃣ Kill Orphaned Telnet Processes**
Once you identify orphaned **Telnetd** processes, use these to **forcefully kill them**.

#### **🔹 Windows Command Prompt**
```cmd
taskkill /IM telnetd.exe /F
```
- Kills **all** running Telnet processes.

```cmd
taskkill /PID <ProcessID> /F
```
- Kills a **specific process ID**.

#### **🔹 PowerShell**
```powershell
Stop-Process -Name telnetd -Force
```
- Stops **all Telnet processes**.

```powershell
Stop-Process -Id <ProcessID> -Force
```
- Stops **a specific Telnet process**.

---

### **6️⃣ MKS Toolkit Commands**
If you're using **MKS Toolkit**, you can run UNIX-style commands in **Windows**.

```sh
ps -ef | grep telnetd
```
- Lists all running **Telnet processes**.

```sh
netstat -a | grep :23
```
- Shows all **Telnet connections**.

```sh
kill -9 <PID>
```
- Force-kills an orphaned process.

```sh
uptime
```
- Shows **system load**, which can help correlate CPU spikes.
